## 🎯 How It Works

### Admin Workflow

```
1. Admin logs in → /admin
2. Clicks "Polls" in navigation → /admin/polls
3. Clicks "Add New Poll"
4. Fills form:
   - Question
   - Options (2-6)
   - Start/End dates
   - Active status
5. Clicks "Preview" to review
6. Clicks "Add Poll" to publish
7. Poll saved to Firestore
8. Poll activates based on schedule
```

### User Workflow

```
1. User visits homepage → /
2. System checks for active polls
3. If poll exists & not seen in session:
   - Poll popup appears
   - User sees question & options
4. User selects option
5. User clicks "Submit Vote"
6. Vote recorded in Firestore
7. Results display with percentages
8. Auto-redirect after 5 seconds
9. Session marked (won't show again)
```

### Auto-Deactivation Flow

```
Every 60 seconds:
1. Fetch all active polls
2. Check current date/time
3. If poll.endDate < now:
   - Set poll.isActive = false
   - Update in Firestore
4. Poll stops showing on homepage
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Data Models

#### Poll Document
```javascript
{
  id: string,
  question: string,
  options: [
    { id: number, text: string },
    ...
  ],
  isActive: boolean,
  startDate: string (ISO datetime),
  endDate: string (ISO datetime),
  createdAt: Firestore Timestamp,
  updatedAt: Firestore Timestamp
}
```

#### Poll Response Document
```javascript
{
  id: string,
  pollId: string,
  optionId: number,
  userId: string (generated),
  votedAt: Firestore Timestamp
}
```

### Storage Keys

- **Session Tracking**: `sessionStorage.poll_seen_{pollId}`
- **Vote Tracking**: `localStorage.poll_voted_{pollId}`
- **User ID**: `localStorage.poll_user_id` (auto-generated UUID)

### API Endpoints (Firestore)

- `GET /polls` - Fetch all polls
- `GET /polls?isActive=true` - Fetch active polls
- `POST /polls` - Create poll
- `PUT /polls/{id}` - Update poll
- `DELETE /polls/{id}` - Delete poll
- `POST /pollResponses` - Submit vote
- `GET /pollResponses?pollId={id}` - Get poll votes

## 📈 Performance Optimizations

- ✅ Real-time listeners with automatic cleanup
- ✅ Client-side vote validation (prevents unnecessary DB calls)
- ✅ Session storage for poll display tracking
- ✅ Lazy loading of analytics data
- ✅ Optimized Firestore queries with filters
- ✅ Debounced auto-deactivation checks (60s intervals)

---

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### Current Implementation
- ✅ Admin routes protected with Firebase Auth
- ✅ Client-side vote tracking (localStorage)
- ✅ Session-based poll display
- ✅ Environment variables for Firebase credentials
- ✅ `.gitignore` configured for secrets

### Production Recommendations
- ⚠️ Implement server-side vote validation
- ⚠️ Add Firestore security rules for write operations
- ⚠️ Consider IP-based rate limiting
- ⚠️ Add CAPTCHA for vote submission (prevent bots)
- ⚠️ Implement analytics data encryption
