System checks for active polls
    ↓
If active poll exists AND user hasn't seen it this session
    ↓
Poll popup appears with fade-in animation
```

### 2. Voting Process
```
User sees poll question and options
    ↓
User selects an option
    ↓

## Technical Architecture

### Data Structure

#### Poll Document (Firestore)
```javascript
{
  id: "auto-generated-id",
  question: "What is your favorite programming language?",
  options: [
    { id: 1, text: "JavaScript" },
    { id: 2, text: "Python" },
    { id: 3, text: "Java" },
    { id: 4, text: "C++" }
  ],
  isActive: true,
  startDate: "2024-01-15T09:00",
  endDate: "2024-01-22T23:59",
  createdAt: Timestamp,
  updatedAt: Timestamp
}
```

#### Poll Response Document (Firestore)
```javascript
{
  id: "auto-generated-id",
  pollId: "poll-document-id",
  optionId: 2,
  userId: "unique-user-identifier",
  votedAt: Timestamp
}
```

### File Structure

```
src/
├── admin/
│   ├── AdminPolls.jsx          # Main poll management UI
│   ├── AdminDashboard.jsx      # Shows poll count in stats
│   ├── AdminNav.jsx            # Navigation with Polls link
│   └── AdminRoutes.jsx         # Routing configuration
├── components/
│   └── PollPopup.jsx           # User-facing poll interface
├── services/

│   └── pollService.js          # Poll-specific logic
└── routes/
    └── AppLayout.jsx           # Poll popup integration
```

### Key Functions

#### pollService.js
```javascript
// Voting
submitVote(pollId, optionId, userId)

// Fetching
getActivePolls()
getPollById(pollId)
hasUserVoted(pollId, userId)

// Analytics
getPollAnalytics(pollId)

// Admin Operations
createPoll(pollData)
updatePoll(pollId, pollData)
deletePoll(pollId)
togglePollStatus(pollId, isActive)
deactivateExpiredPolls()
```

### Real-time Updates

The system uses Firestore real-time listeners for:
- **Admin Dashboard**: Live poll count
- **Admin Polls Page**: Instant updates when polls change
- **Poll Analytics**: Real-time vote counting

### Auto-Deactivation

```javascript
// Runs every 60 seconds
setInterval(async () => {
  await pollService.deactivateExpiredPolls();
}, 60000);
```

Automatically sets `isActive: false` for polls where:
- Current date/time > endDate
- Poll is currently active

## Integration with Existing Systems

### Firebase Collections

The poll system adds two new collections:

1. **`polls`** - Poll documents
2. **`pollResponses`** - Vote records

These are defined in `src/services/firestoreService.js`:
```javascript
export const COLLECTIONS = {
  // ... existing collections
  POLLS: 'polls',
  POLL_RESPONSES: 'pollResponses',
};
```

### Admin Dashboard

Poll count is displayed in:
- Stats grid (5th card)
- Quick Access section (8th card)

Real-time subscription ensures count updates automatically.

### Homepage Integration

Poll popup is integrated in `AppLayout.jsx`:
- Checks for active polls on mount
- Uses session tracking to prevent re-display
- Only shows on home page (`/`)

---

## Security Considerations

### Vote Validation
- Uses localStorage with unique user IDs
- Server-side validation recommended for production
- Consider IP-based rate limiting for high-traffic sites

### Admin Access
- Only authenticated admins can manage polls
- Protected routes prevent unauthorized access
- Firebase security rules should restrict write access

### Data Privacy
- Votes are anonymous (no personal data collected)
- User IDs are randomly generated client-side
- Consider GDPR compliance for EU users

---

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Features
- [ ] Multi-select polls (choose multiple options)
- [ ] Poll templates for quick creation
- [ ] Export analytics to CSV
- [ ] Email notifications for poll results
- [ ] Scheduled poll campaigns
- [ ] A/B testing for poll questions
- [ ] Social media sharing of results
- [ ] Poll widgets for embedding on other pages

### Performance Improvements
- [ ] Implement server-side vote validation
- [ ] Add caching for frequently accessed polls
- [ ] Optimize Firestore queries with composite indexes
- [ ] Add pagination for poll list (if >50 polls)
